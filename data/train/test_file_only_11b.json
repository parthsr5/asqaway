In proband 1 (V1/V2), V1 was predicted to introduce a premature termination codon (premature termination codon), whereas V2 disrupted the exon 41 splice donor site causing incomplete skipping of exon 41. V1 and V2 impaired dynein-2 motility in vitro and perturbed IFT88 distribution within cilia. V3, homozygous in probands 2-4, is predicted to cause a premature termination codon in a retina-predominant transcript. Analysis of retinal organoids showed that this new transcript expression increased with organoid differentiation. V4, a novel missense variant, was in trans with V5, previously associated with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy).CONCLUSION: The DYNC2H1 variants discussed herein were either hypomorphic or affecting a retina-predominant transcript and caused nonsyndromic IRD.

Extensive functional analyses of the missense variant in cell culture and zebrafish strongly suggests its pathogenic nature. Loss of IFT81 impairs ciliogenesis and, interestingly, the missense variant displayed significantly reduced rescue of ciliogenesis in the IFT81 knockdown in vitro system. Consistently, dramatic reduction of rescue efficiency of the ift81 mutant zebrafish embryo by messenger RNA with the missense variant was observed, further supporting its pathogenicity.Conclusions: Consistent with the function of the intraflagellar transport-B complex in the maintenance of photoreceptor cilium, we report a case of mutations in a core intraflagellar transport-B protein, IFT81. This represents the first report of mutations in IFT81 as a candidate gene for nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy, hence expanding the phenotype spectrum of intraflagellar transport-B components."

To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276\u2009G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802\u2009T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073\u2009G>Ankylosing spondyliti, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156\u2009G>Ankylosing spondyliti, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3\u2009T>Ankylosing spondyliti; and c.12575\u2009G>Ankylosing spondyliti, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. Careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting."

Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RNA binding domain). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other neurodevelopmental disorder-associated THOC subunits. Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 neurodevelopmental disorders to language disorder and/or incidental durotomy, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. Ankylosing spondyliti subset of affected individuals' has severe-profound incidental durotomy, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities.

Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 neurodevelopmental disorders to language disorder and/or incidental durotomy, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. Ankylosing spondyliti subset of affected individuals' has severe-profound incidental durotomy, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities. Further investigations to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for this severe phenotype are warranted."

Following a literature search, we also reviewed clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and genetic features of 19 patients with GRIA3 mutations.RESULTS: This 26-month-old boy had developmental delay, early onset refractory myoclonic epilepsy, and non-convulsive refractory status epilepticus. In published reports, epilepsy was in 6 of 19 patients carrying different genotypes, though epilepsy and electroencephalogram features were not completely defined. Out of the 6 patients, one presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, two with myoclonic and clonic events (one also presented with epileptic spasms), and one with atypical absences and myoclonic jerks. Information on type of epilepsy was unavailable for 3 cases. Epilepsy onset was early in life and there was potential tendency for myoclonic/clonic events. The epilepsy was difficult to treat and prognosis is poor. Severity of incidental durotomy ranged from mild to severe and was variably associated with bipolar affective disorder and autistic spectrum disorders. Other neurological features included hypotonia, asthenic body habitus with poor muscle bulk, and hyporeflexia.CONCLUSION: Our report expands knowledge on the electro-clinical and molecular spectrum of GRIA3 variants. Larger investigations will better define the prevalence of epilepsy, the epileptic phenotype, and syndromic features underlying GRIA3 variants."

FHF dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy. Here, we describe two sibling pairs and three unrelated males who presented in infancy with intractable focal seizures and severe developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing identified hemi- and heterozygous variants in the N-terminal domain of the Ankylosing spondyliti isoform of FHF2 (FHF2A). The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function."

            "context": "Joubert syndrome (Joubert syndrome) is a recessive neurodevelopmental ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic hindbrain malformation. All known Joubert syndrome genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. Here, we used the recently identified Joubert syndrome-associated protein armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 (armadillo repeat motif-containing 9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies Joubert syndrome. In addition to the known Joubert syndrome-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1) as armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 interaction partners. We found that TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 variants cause Joubert syndrome and disrupt TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 interaction with armadillo repeat motif-containing 9. Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and Human telomerase reverse transcriptase-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 or TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and cold-induced depolymerization in armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 patient cell lines suggest a role for this new Joubert syndrome-associated protein module in ciliary stability."

Novel rare variants in the gene identified were independently identified in a cohort of 680 adult-onset patients. Variants were expressed in COS cells and function assessed by patch-clamp and rubidium flux analysis.RESULTS: We identified a de novo novel heterozygous predicted deleterious missense variant c.G2873A (p.R958H) in ABCC8 in a child with idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. We then evaluated all individuals in the original and a second cohort for rare or novel variants in ABCC8 and identified 11 additional heterozygous predicted damaging ABCC8 variants. ABCC8 encodes SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor 1)-a regulatory subunit of the adenosine-5'-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel. We observed loss of adenosine-5'-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel function for all ABCC8 variants evaluated and pharmacological rescue of all channel currents in vitro by the SUR1 activator, diazoxide.CONCLUSIONS: Novel and rare missense variants in ABCC8 are associated with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Identified ABCC8 mutations decreased adenosine-5'-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel function, which was pharmacologically recovered."

Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (deep cancer subtype classification), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, deep cancer subtype classification classifiers and deep cancer subtype classification single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (random forests), support vector machine (support vector machine), gradient boosting machine (gradient boosting machine), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of deep cancer subtype classification to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by deep cancer subtype classification captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, deep cancer subtype classification provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping."

Whole-exome sequencing (Whole-exome sequencing) variant prioritization coupled with phenotype-guided clinical and bioinformatics expertise is typically used to identify disease-causing variants; however, it can be challenging to identify the causal candidate gene when a large number of rare and potentially pathogenic variants are detected. Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (uses untargeted metabolomics) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al. (2015) and 11 patients with both central nervous system and metabolic abnormalities. The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization. The results of this study indicate that network-based analysis of uses untargeted metabolomics data can provide an additional mode of evidence to prioritize causal genes in patients with suspected IEMs."

Recent work has focused on the improvement of the Eukaryotic Promoter Database promoter viewers, which use the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser as visualization platform. Thousands of high-resolution tracks for Capped Analysis of Gene Expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing and similar data have been generated and organized into public track hubs. Customized, reproducible promoter views, combining Eukaryotic Promoter Database-supplied tracks with native University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser tracks, can be accessed from the organism summary pages or from individual promoter entries. Moreover, thanks to recent improvements and stabilization of non-coding RNA gene catalogs, we were able to release promoter collections for certain classes of Noncoding RNAs from human and mouse. Furthermore, we developed automatic computational protocols to assign orphan transcription start site peaks to downstream genes based on paired-end (RAMPAGE) transcription start site mapping data, which enabled us to add nearly 9000 new entries to the human promoter collection."

The statistics is used to assess the significance of an over-representation of microRNA-target interactions and then MIENTURNET filters based on the statistical significance associated with each microRNA-target interaction. In addition, the holistic approach of the network theory is used to infer possible evidences of microRNA regulation by capturing emergent properties of the microRNA-target regulatory network that would be not evident through a pairwise analysis of the individual components.CONCLUSION: MIENTURNET offers the possibility to consistently perform both statistical and network-based analyses by using only a single tool leading to a more effective prioritization of the microRNA-target interactions. This has the potential to avoid researchers without computational and informatics skills to navigate multiple websites and thus to independently investigate microRNA activity in every cellular process of interest in an easy and at the same time exhaustive way thanks to the intuitive web interface. The web application along with a well-documented and comprehensive user guide are freely available at http://userver.bio.uniroma1.it/applications/mienturnet/ without any login requirement."

We have previously shown that a specific apoE4 fragment, apoE4-165, promotes amyloid-peptide beta 42 (A\u03b242) accumulation in human neuroblastoma stromal keratitis-N-SH cells and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species formation, two events considered to occur early in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

Here, using KLF4 as a paradigm, we provide a transcription-factor-centric view of chromatin reorganization and its association with three-dimensional enhancer rewiring and transcriptional changes during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells. Inducible depletion of KLF factors in PSCs caused a genome-wide decrease in enhancer connectivity, whereas disruption of individual KLF4 binding sites within pluripotent-stem-cell-specific enhancers was sufficient to impair enhancer-promoter contacts and reduce the expression of associated genes."

TADCompare is based on a spectral clustering-derived measure called the eigenvector gap, which enables a loci-by-loci comparison of boundary differences. Using this measure, we introduce methods for identifying differential and consensus boundaries of interacting domains and tracking boundary changes over time. We further propose a novel framework for the systematic classification of boundary changes. Colocalization- and gene enrichment analysis of different types of boundary changes demonstrated distinct biological functionality associated with them. TADCompare is available on https://github.com/dozmorovlab/TADCompare and Bioconductor (submitted)."

We demonstrate that transactivation domains boundaries shared among multiple levels of the transactivation domains hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of transcription activation domains that cannot be split into sub-transcription activation domains showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.CONCLUSION: SpectralTAD is available on Bioconductor, http://bioconductor.org/packages/SpectralTAD/ ."

The regutools package serves as a bridge between RegulonDB data and the Bioconductor ecosystem by reusing the data structures and statistical methods powered by other Bioconductor packages. We demonstrate the integration of regutools with Bioconductor by analyzing transcription factor deoxyribonucleic acid binding sites and transcriptional regulatory networks from RegulonDB. We anticipate that regutools will serve as a useful building block in our progress to further our understanding of gene regulatory networks.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: regutools is an R package available through Bioconductor at bioconductor.org/packages/regutools."

The second round of whole-genome duplication resulted in one copy of the conserved noncoding element within HOTAIR and another copy embedded in noncoding transcript of HOXD11. Paralogous coding elements underwent compensatory mutations, exhibit sequence complementarity with respect to transcripts directionality, and have high affinity in\u00a0vitro.

Clinically, these deletions are considered to be part of a unique microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability and speech impairment, typical dysmorphic features, structural anomalies of the brain, microcephaly, and non-specific multiple organ anomalies. The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and hearing loss. Chromosome analysis by array-Comparative genomic hybridization revealed a small interstitial 6q deletion spanning approximately 1.1 Mb of deoxyribonucleic acid and containing only one coding gene, ARID1B. We suggest that ARID1B is the key gene behind 6q microdeletion syndrome, and we discuss its possible role in the phenotypic manifestations."

An improved understanding of the genetic control of gene expression in human brain is vital considering this is the likely modus operandum for many causal variants. However, human brain sampling complexities limit the explanatory power of brain-related expression quantitative trait loci (expression quantitative trait loci) and allele-specific expression (allele-specific expression) signals. We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts. We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci, find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for regulatory information of neuron-specific genes, that ASEs provide cell-specific regulatory information with evidence for cellular specificity, and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease. This resource of regulatory data is accessible through our web\u00a0server, http://braineacv2.inf.um.es/."

In this study, up-regulation of microRNA-182 was validated in triple-negative breast cancer patients and cell lines. Knockdown of microRNA-182 was observed to hinder the proliferation of bleeding time-549 cells. More importantly, knockdown of microRNA-182 significantly promoted the apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 treatment in bleeding time-549. JC-1 staining and western blot assays revealed that the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on receptor-interacting protein 1 (receptor-interacting protein 1) were removed and the outer mitochondrial membrane potential (matrix metalloproteinase) and permeability was altered upon combination of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 with anti-microRNA-182. We then demonstrated that knockdown of microRNA-182 up-regulated the expression of cylindromatosis (cylindromatosis) deubiquitinase, which promoted the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (death-inducing signaling complex) and subsequent caspase-8 activation in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-treated bleeding time-549 cells. Collectively, the results of the present study improve our understanding of the role of microRNA-182 in triple-negative breast cancer, knockdown of which facilitates the degradation of ubiquitin chains on receptor-interacting protein 1, leading to the caspase-8 activation and apoptosis in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-treated triple-negative breast cancer cells. This may be valuable for the development of cancer therapy."

Antisense oligonucleotides targeting the same long noncoding RNAs exhibited global concordance, and the molecular phenotype, measured by Capped Analysis of Gene Expression, recapitulated the observed cellular phenotypes while providing additional insights on the affected genes and pathways. Here, we disseminate the largest-to-date long noncoding RNA knockdown data set with molecular phenotyping (over 1000 Capped Analysis of Gene Expression deep-sequencing libraries) for further exploration and highlight functional roles for ZNF213-AS1 and long non-coding-KHDC3L-2."

We applied INDEED for analysis of two omic datasets acquired in a cancer biomarker discovery study to help rank disease-associated biomolecules. We believe biomolecules selected by INDEED lead to improved sensitivity and specificity in detecting disease status compared to those selected by conventional statistical methods. Also, INDEED's framework is amenable to further expansion to integrate networks from multi-omic studies, thereby allowing selection of reliable disease-associated biomolecules or disease biomarkers."

We also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the Escherichia coli bacteria. To do sine oculis, we computed 1 million Elementary flux modes for each energetic amino acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino acid based on gene/protein expression data and the obtained Elementary flux modes. We found good agreement between previous experiments and the conclusions reached using Elementary flux modes. Finally, we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large genome-scale metabolic networks.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The stand-alone software TreeEFM is implemented in C++ and interacts with the open-source linear solver COIN-odds ratio Linear program Solver (CLP)."

We base our method on a further study of the final tableau of the simplex method. By performing additional elementary steps and avoiding trivial solutions consisting of two cycles, we obtain many more Elementary flux modes for each Lucio's phenomenon problem posed, improving the efficiency rate of previously proposed methods by more than one order of magnitude."

            "context": "Publicly available RNA sequencing data is routinely used for retrospective analysis to elucidate new biology. Novel transcript discovery enabled by joint analysis of large collections of RNA sequencing data sets has emerged as one such analysis. Current methods for transcript discovery rely on a '2-Step' approach where the first step encompasses building transcripts from individual data sets, followed by the second step that merges predicted transcripts across data sets. To increase the power of transcript discovery from large collections of RNA sequencing data sets, we developed a novel '1-Step' approach named Pooling RNA sequencing and Assembling Models (Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models) that builds transcript models from pooled RNA sequencing data sets. We demonstrate in a computational benchmark that 1-Step outperforms 2-Step approaches in predicting overall transcript structures and individual splice junctions, while performing competitively in detecting exonic nucleotides. Applying Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models to 30 human ENCODE RNA sequencing data sets identified unannotated transcripts with epigenetic and RAMPAGE signatures similar to those of recently annotated transcripts. In a case study, we discovered and experimentally validated new transcripts through the application of Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models to mouse hematopoietic RNA sequencing data sets. We uncovered new transcripts that share a differential expression pattern with a neighboring gene Pik3cg implicated in human hematopoietic phenotypes, and we provided evidence for the conservation of this relationship in human. Pooling RNA-seq and Assembling Models is implemented as an R/Bioconductor package."

Here we describe a syndrome of BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity) that results from BACH2 haploinsufficiency. Affected subjects had lymphocyte-maturation defects that caused immunoglobulin deficiency and intestinal inflammation. The mutations disrupted protein stability by interfering with homodimerization or by causing aggregation. We observed analogous lymphocyte defects in Bach2-heterozygous mice. More generally, we observed that genes that cause monogenic haploinsufficient diseases were substantially enriched for TFs and super-enhancer architecture. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of super-enhancer architecture in Mendelian diseases of immunity: heterozygous mutations in super-enhancer-regulated genes identified by whole-exome/genome sequencing may have greater significance than previously recognized."

Focusing on epigenetic regulators, we identified WDR5, a core member of the COMPASS histone histone 3 Lys4 (H3K4) mixed-lineage leukemia protein (1-4) methyltransferase complex, as a top tumor maintenance hit required across multiple human and mouse tumors. Mechanistically, WDR5 functions to sustain proper execution of deoxyribonucleic acid replication in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, as previously suggested by replication stress studies involving mixed-lineage leukemia 1, and c-Myc, also found to interact with WDR5. We indeed demonstrate that interaction with c-Myc is critical for this function. By showing that atorvastatin inhibition mimicked the effects of WDR5 suppression, these data provide rationale to test atorvastatin and WDR5 inhibitors for activity in this disease."

With lipidomics datasets becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through integration with the Metabolomics Workbench application programming interface, users can search, download, and reanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data inspection, normalization, and uni- and multivariate analyses, displaying results as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class, chain length, and total unsaturation data, we also developed and implemented a novel lipid set enrichment analysis. Ankylosing spondyliti companion online guide with two live example datasets is presented at https://www.lipidr.org/. We expect that the ease of use and innovative features of lipidr will allow the lipidomics research community to gain novel detailed insights from lipidomics data."

We report new disease presentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup of patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to the previously reported systemic features, our study has identified co-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth retardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in tandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5-37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke Fahn Marsden's Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-multiple sclerosi and BFMDRS-D) was evident at 6 months, 1 year and last follow-up (motor, P = 0.001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.012; disability, P = 0.009, P = 0.002 and P = 0.012). At 1 year post-deep brain stimulation, >50% of subjects showed BFMDRS-multiple sclerosi and BFMDRS-D improvements of >30%. In the long-term deep brain stimulation cohort (deep brain stimulation inserted for >5 years, n = 8), improvement of >30% was maintained in 5/8 and 3/8 subjects for the BFMDRS-multiple sclerosi and BFMDRS-D, respectively. The greatest BFMDRS-multiple sclerosi improvements were observed for trunk (53.2%) and cervical (50.5%) dystonia, with less clinical impact on laryngeal dystonia. Improvements in gait dystonia decreased from 20.9% at 1 year to 16.2% at last assessment; no patient maintained a fully independent gait. Reduction of BFMDRS-D was maintained for swallowing (52.9%). Five patients developed mild parkinsonism following deep brain stimulation. KMT2B-related disease comprises an expanding continuum from infancy to adulthood, with early evidence of genotype-phenotype correlations. Except for laryngeal dysphonia, deep brain stimulation provides a significant improvement in quality of life and function with sustained clinical benefit depending on symptoms distribution."

Traditional analysis methods analyze each type of data individually and integrate their results using Venn diagrams. Challenges arise, however, when the results are irreproducible and inconsistent across multiple platforms. To address these issues, one possible approach is to concurrently analyze both gene expression profiling and CNAs in the same individual.RESULTS: We have developed an open-source R/Bioconductor package (iGC). Multiple input formats are supported and users can define their own criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes driven by CNAs. The analysis of two real microarray datasets demonstrated that the Copy Number Alterations-driven genes identified by the iGC package showed significantly higher Pearson correlation coefficients with their gene expression levels and copy numbers than those genes located in a genomic region with Copy Number Alterations. Compared with the Venn diagram approach, the iGC package showed better performance.CONCLUSION: The iGC package is effective and useful for identifying Copy Number Alterations-driven genes. By simultaneously considering both comparative genomic and transcriptomic data, it can provide better understanding of biological and medical questions. The iGC package's source code and manual are freely available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/iGC.html"

Available software for integrative analysis arbitrarily fixes the parametric form of the association between the two molecular levels and hence offers no opportunities for modelling it. We present a new tool for flexible modelling of this association. PLRS uses a wide class of interpretable models including popular ones and incorporates prior biological knowledge. It is capable to identify the gene-specific type of relationship between gene copy number and messenger RNA expression. Moreover, it tests the strength of the association and provides confidence intervals. We illustrate PLRS using glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PLRS is implemented as an R package and available from Bioconductor (as of version 2.12; http://bioconductor.org).

However, analysis of somatic copy-number changes from sequencing data is still challenging because of insufficient sequencing coverage, unknown tumor sample purity and subclonal heterogeneity. Here we describe a computational framework, named SomatiCA, which explicitly accounts for tumor purity and subclonality in the analysis of somatic copy-number profiles. Taking read depths (read depths) and lesser allele frequencies (lesser allele frequencies) as input, SomatiCA will output 1) admixture rate for each tumor sample, 2) somatic allelic copy-number for each genomic segment, 3) fraction of tumor cells with subclonal change in each somatic copy number aberration (somatic copy number aberration), and 4) a list of substantial genomic aberration events including gain, loss and loss of heterozygosity.

While genotyping algorithms are largely concordant when assessed on haplotype map project samples, tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides allele-specific estimates of copy number. This paper illustrates a workflow for the estimation of allele-specific copy number and integration of the marker-level estimates with complimentary Bioconductor software for inferring regions of copy number gain or loss.

            "context": "Most approaches used to find recurrent or differential deoxyribonucleic acid Copy Number Alterations (Copy Number Alterations) in array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array Comparative Genomic Hybridization) data from groups of tumour samples depend on the discretization of the array Comparative Genomic Hybridization data to gain, loss or no-change states. This causes loss of valuable biological information in tumour samples, which are frequently heterogeneous. We have previously developed an algorithm, KC-SMART, that bases its estimate of the magnitude of the Copy Number Alterations at a given genomic location on kernel convolution (Klijn et al., 2008). This accounts for the intensity of the probe signal, its local genomic environment and the signal distribution across multiple samples.RESULTS: Here we extend the approach to allow comparative analyses of two groups of samples and introduce the R implementation of these two approaches. The comparative module allows for a supervised analysis to be performed, to enable the identification of regions that are differentially aberrated between two user-defined classes.We analyzed data from a series of B- and T-cell lymphomas and were able to retrieve all positive control regions (VDJ regions) in addition to a number of new regions. Ankylosing spondyliti t-test employing segmented data, that we implemented, was also able to locate all the positive control regions and a number of new regions but these regions were highly fragmented.CONCLUSIONS: KC-SMARTR offers recurrent Copy Number Alterations and class specific Copy Number Alterations detection, at different genomic scales, in a single package without the need for additional segmentation. It is memory efficient and runs on a wide range of machines. Most importantly, it does not rely on data discretization and therefore maximally exploits the biological information in the array Comparative Genomic Hybridization data.The program is freely available from the Bioconductor website http://www.bioconductor.org/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License."

In contrast to Pfam's profile Hidden Markov Model which detects G\u03b1 subunits in general, our method not only detects G\u03b1 subunits but also classifies them into the appropriate G\u03b1-protein family and thus could become a useful tool for the annotation of G-proteins in newly discovered proteomes.

We describe novel KARS1-associated signs such as autism, hyperactive behavior, pontine hypoplasia, and cerebellar atrophy with prevalent vermian involvement. Loss of kars1 leads to upregulation of protein 53, tissue-specific apoptosis, and downregulation of neurodevelopmental related genes, recapitulating key tissue-specific disease phenotypes of patients."

We identified a novel association between the coding variant (p.Pro50Thr) in AKT2 and fasting plasma insulin (fasting plasma insulin), a gene in which rare fully penetrant mutations are causal for monogenic glycemic disorders. The low-frequency allele is associated with a 12% increase in fasting plasma insulin levels. This variant is present at 1.1% frequency in Finns but virtually absent in individuals from other ancestries. Carriers of the fasting plasma insulin-increasing allele had increased 2-h insulin values, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.05). In cellular studies, the AKT2-Thr50 protein exhibited a partial loss of function. We extend the allelic spectrum for coding variants in AKT2 associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis and demonstrate bidirectional effects of variants within the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT2."

The proposed SCDRHA consists of two core modules, where the first module is a deep count autoencoder (deep count autoencoder) that is used to denoise data, and the second module is a graph autoencoder that projects the data into a low-dimensional space. Experimental results demonstrate that SCDRHA has better performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms on dimension reduction and noise reduction in five real scRNA-seq datasets. Besides, SCDRHA can also dramatically improve the performance of data visualization and cell clustering."

We added 298 new profiles to the Unvalidated collection when no orthogonal evidence was found in the literature. All the profiles were clustered to provide familial binding profiles for each taxonomic group. Moreover, we revised the structural classification of deoxyribonucleic acid binding domains to consider plant-specific TFs. This release introduces word clouds to represent the scientific knowledge associated with each transcription factor. We updated the genome tracks of TFBSs predicted with JASPAR profiles in eight organisms; the human and mouse transcription factor binding site predictions can be visualized as native tracks in the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser. Finally, we provide a new tool to perform JASPAR transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis in user-provided genomic regions. All the data is accessible through the JASPAR website, its associated RESTful application programming interface, the R/Bioconductor data package, and a new Python package, pyJASPAR, that facilitates serverless access to the data."
