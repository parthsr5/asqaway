Several strategies have been previously used (drop duplicated genes, distribute uniformly the reads, or estimate expression), but all of them provide biased results.RESULTS: We provide here a tool, called mmquant, for computing gene expression, included duplicated genes. If a read maps at different positions, the tool detects that the corresponding genes are duplicated; it merges the genes and creates a merged gene. The counts of ambiguous reads is then based on the input genes and the merged genes.CONCLUSION: mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way."}, {"id": "5c58282e07647bbc4b00001e_0003", "question": "Name the algorithms for counting multi-mapping reads", "answers": {"text": ["EMASE"], "answer_start": [954]}, "type": "list", "context": "Allele-specific expression (allele-specific expression) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA sequencing) can provide quantitative estimates of allele-specific expression for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority (>85%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and allele-specific expression based on this hierarchical allocation."}, {"id": "5c58282e07647bbc4b00001e_0004", "question": "Name the algorithms for counting multi-mapping reads", "answers": {"text": ["mmquant"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "list", "context": "mmquant: how to count multi-mapping reads?mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way."}, {"id": "5c58282e07647bbc4b00001e_0005", "question": "Name the algorithms for counting multi-mapping reads", "answers": {"text": ["mmquant"], "answer_start": [11]}, "type": "list", "context": "CONCLUSION\nmmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way."}, {"id": "5c58282e07647bbc4b00001e_0006", "question": "Name the algorithms for counting multi-mapping reads", "answers": {"text": ["mmquant"], "answer_start": [11]}, "type": "list", "context": "CONCLUSION mmquant is a drop-in replacement of the widely used tools htseq-count and featureCounts that handles multi-mapping reads in an unabiased way."}, {"id": "5c53191a7e3cb0e231000016_0001", "question": "What periodontal disease associated bacteria is also associated with Alzheimer's disease?", "answers": {"text": ["Porphyromonas gingivalis"], "answer_start": [103]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Among bacteria special attention is focused on spirochetes family and on periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis or Treponema denticola that could cause chronic periodontitis and possibly contribute to the clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease."}, {"id": "5c53191a7e3cb0e231000016_0002", "question": "What periodontal disease associated bacteria is also associated with Alzheimer's disease?", "answers": {"text": ["Porphyromonas gingivalis"], "answer_start": [191]}, "type": "factoid", "context": " working hypothesis links extrinsic inflammation as a secondary cause of Alzheimer's disease.

TBC1 domain family member 16 (TBC1D16), a GTPase-activating protein, is involved in regulating intracellular trafficking in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the clinical significance of TBC1D16 in Epithelial ovarian cancer remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression and prognostic significance of TBC1D16 in Epithelial ovarian cancer and its relationship with the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor). The tissue specimens included 156 histologically confirmed Epithelial ovarian cancer and 30 normal ovarian tissues. The expression of TBC1D16 and vascular endothelial growth factor was detected by immunohistochemistry (immunohistochemistry), and the immunoreactive score was calculated with signal intensity and percentage of positive cells. immunohistochemistry results showed that TBC1D16 and vascular endothelial growth factor were both mainly localized in cytoplasm of epithelial cells in normal ovarian tissues and were expressed in cancer cells. Based on the immunoreactive score, TBC1D16 expression in Epithelial ovarian cancer was categorized as \"high expression,\" compared with normal ovarian tissues (P < 0.05). The Chi-square test showed that high TBC1D16 expression was related to advanced pT stages (P = 0.029), but not correlated with other clinical features. Moreover, the TBC1D16 expression was significantly higher in Epithelial ovarian cancer specimens with low vascular endothelial growth factor expression (P < 0.001). Importantly, in both univariate and multivariate survival analyses, high expression of TBC1D16 was significantly correlated with good overall survival (overall survival).

To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276\u2009G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802\u2009T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073\u2009G>Ankylosing spondyliti, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156\u2009G>Ankylosing spondyliti, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3\u2009T>Ankylosing spondyliti; and c.12575\u2009G>Ankylosing spondyliti, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome.

Following a literature search, we also reviewed clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and genetic features of 19 patients with GRIA3 mutations.RESULTS: This 26-month-old boy had developmental delay, early onset refractory myoclonic epilepsy, and non-convulsive refractory status epilepticus. In published reports, epilepsy was in 6 of 19 patients carrying different genotypes, though epilepsy and electroencephalogram features were not completely defined. Out of the 6 patients, one presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, two with myoclonic and clonic events (one also presented with epileptic spasms), and one with atypical absences and myoclonic jerks. Information on type of epilepsy was unavailable for 3 cases. Epilepsy onset was early in life and there was potential tendency for myoclonic/clonic events. The epilepsy was difficult to treat and prognosis is poor. Severity of incidental durotomy ranged from mild to severe and was variably associated with bipolar affective disorder and autistic spectrum disorders. Other neurological features included hypotonia, asthenic body habitus with poor muscle bulk, and hyporeflexia.CONCLUSION: Our report expands knowledge on the electro-clinical and molecular spectrum of GRIA3 variants.

FHF dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy. Here, we describe two sibling pairs and three unrelated males who presented in infancy with intractable focal seizures and severe developmental delay. Whole-exome sequencing identified hemi- and heterozygous variants in the N-terminal domain of the Ankylosing spondyliti isoform of FHF2 (FHF2A). The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence. The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels. Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1.6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties. These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants. Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function."}, {"id": "5e9209792d3121100d00000b_0001", "question": "List enzymes that removes histone modifications.", "answers": {"text": ["Lysine Specific Demethylases"], "answer_start": [2]}, "type": "list", "context": ", Lysine Specific Demethylases (Lysine Specific Demethylases) removes methylated histone histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9)"}, {"id": "5e9209792d3121100d00000b_0002", "question": "List enzymes that removes histone modifications.", "answers": {"text": ["Histone deacetylases"], "answer_start": [70]}, "type": "list", "context": "Ankylosing spondyliti family of enzymes, namely histone deacetylases (Histone deacetylases), removes these PTMs. "}, {"id": "5e9209792d3121100d00000b_0003", "question": "List enzymes that removes histone modifications.", "answers": {"text": ["Histone deacetylases"], "answer_start": [1]}, "type": "list", "context": " Histone deacetylases (Histone deacetylases), a specific epigenetic group of enzymes, dynamically and reversibly removes acetyl groups from histone tails projecting from the nucleosome."}, {"id": "5e44cf61f5547e6e27000001_0001", "question": "What is targeted by Pexidartinib?", "answers": {"text": ["colony stimulating factor 1 receptor"], "answer_start": [131]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Elucidation of the importance of the colony-stimulating factor (colony-stimulating factor 1)/colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor) pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease has created significant interest in targeting this pathway as a novel TGCT treatment approach.

Clinically, these deletions are considered to be part of a unique microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual disability and speech impairment, typical dysmorphic features, structural anomalies of the brain, microcephaly, and non-specific multiple organ anomalies. The critical region for the interstitial 6q microdeletion phenotype was mapped to 6q24-6q25, particularly the 6q25.3 region containing the genes ARID1B and ZDHHC14. It has been hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of these genes impairs normal development of the brain and is responsible for the phenotype. This case report describes a girl presenting with typical features of 6q microdeletion syndrome, including global developmental delay, speech impairment, distinct dysmorphic features, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, common limb anomalies, and hearing loss. Chromosome analysis by array-Comparative genomic hybridization revealed a small interstitial 6q deletion spanning approximately 1.1 Mb of deoxyribonucleic acid and containing only one coding gene, ARID1B.

Traditional analysis methods analyze each type of data individually and integrate their results using Venn diagrams. Challenges arise, however, when the results are irreproducible and inconsistent across multiple platforms. To address these issues, one possible approach is to concurrently analyze both gene expression profiling and CNAs in the same individual.RESULTS: We have developed an open-source R/Bioconductor package (iGC). Multiple input formats are supported and users can define their own criteria for identifying differentially expressed genes driven by CNAs. The analysis of two real microarray datasets demonstrated that the Copy Number Alterations-driven genes identified by the iGC package showed significantly higher Pearson correlation coefficients with their gene expression levels and copy numbers than those genes located in a genomic region with Copy Number Alterations. Compared with the Venn diagram approach, the iGC package showed better performance.CONCLUSION: The iGC package is effective and useful for identifying Copy Number Alterations-driven genes. By simultaneously considering both comparative genomic and transcriptomic data, it can provide better understanding of biological and medical questions.

Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides allele-specific estimates of copy number. This paper illustrates a workflow for the estimation of allele-specific copy number and integration of the marker-level estimates with complimentary Bioconductor software for inferring regions of copy number gain or loss. All analyses are performed in the statistical environment R."}, {"id": "601ec0c91cb411341a00005f_0014", "question": "Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?", "answers": {"text": ["KC-SMARTR"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "list", "context": "KC-SMARTR: An R package for detection of statistically significant aberrations in multi-experiment array Comparative Genomic Hybridization data."}, {"id": "601ec0c91cb411341a00005f_0015", "question": "Which R/bioconductor have been developed for copy number analysis?", "answers": {"text": ["KC-SMARTR"], "answer_start": [1516]}, "type": "list", "context": "Most approaches used to find recurrent or differential deoxyribonucleic acid Copy Number Alterations (Copy Number Alterations) in array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array Comparative Genomic Hybridization) data from groups of tumour samples depend on the discretization of the array Comparative Genomic Hybridization data to gain, loss or no-change states. This causes loss of valuable biological information in tumour samples, which are frequently heterogeneous. We have previously developed an algorithm, KC-SMART, that bases its estimate of the magnitude of the Copy Number Alterations at a given genomic location on kernel convolution (Klijn et al., 2008). This accounts for the intensity of the probe signal, its local genomic environment and the signal distribution across multiple samples.RESULTS: Here we extend the approach to allow comparative analyses of two groups of samples and introduce the R implementation of these two approaches. The comparative module allows for a supervised analysis to be performed, to enable the identification of regions that are differentially aberrated between two user-defined classes.We analyzed data from a series of B- and T-cell lymphomas and were able to retrieve all positive control regions (VDJ regions) in addition to a number of new regions. Ankylosing spondyliti t-test employing segmented data, that we implemented, was also able to locate all the positive control regions and a number of new regions but these regions were highly fragmented.CONCLUSIONS: KC-SMARTR offers recurrent Copy Number Alterations and class specific Copy Number Alterations detection, at different genomic scales, in a single package without the need for additional segmentation. It is memory efficient and runs on a wide range of machines. Most importantly, it does not rely on data discretization and therefore maximally exploits the biological information in the array Comparative Genomic Hybridization data.The program is freely available from the Bioconductor website http://www.bioconductor.org/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License."}, {"id": "606b7d6c94d57fd87900006f_0001", "question": "Which protein does capmatinib bind?", "answers": {"text": ["mesenchymal-epithelial transition"], "answer_start": [50]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Capmatinib (Tabrecta\u2122) is an oral, small molecule mesenchymal-epithelial transition (mesenchymal-epithelial transition) inhibitor being developed by Novartis Oncology, under a license from Incyte Corporation, for the treatment of lung cancer.
