"answer_start": [673]}, "context": "in cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrently mutated more than expected. noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. this is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called larva. it integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a \u03b2-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. larva, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. we demonstrate larva's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the tert promoter. furthermore, larva highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. we make larva available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org)."}, {"id": "589635dd78275d0c4a000009_0003", "question": "Which tool is used for the identification of recurrent variants in

detail in this review, allowed belimumab\u00a0-\u00a0a monoclonal antibody against blys (b-lymphocyte stimulator)\u00a0-\u00a0to become the first biotherapy approved for use in sle. other molecules targeting b cells include the two anti-blys antibodies tabalumab and blisibimod; atacicept, which targets both blys and april (a proliferation-inducing ligand); and the monoclonal antibody to cd22 epratuzumab. the rekindling of interest in the b-cell pathway has also driven new clinical research into rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting cd20 with evaluations of new strategies. a new and

"intrinsic disorder (id), i.e. the lack of a unique folded conformation at physiological conditions, is a common feature for many proteins, which requires specialized biochemical experiments that are not high-throughput. missing x-ray residues from the pdb have been widely used as a proxy for id when developing computational methods. this may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant id. large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated id are scarce. recently, the disprot database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated id annotations for several hundred new proteins. this provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training id predictors.results: here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of id predictors on the new disprot dataset. in contrast to previous assessments based on missing x-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long id regions and a significant amount of fully id proteins. the benchmarking shows that id predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long id segments. however, a large fraction of id still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for pdb data. in particular, many predictors appear to confound id and regions outside x-ray structures. this suggests that the id prediction methods capture different flavors of disorder and can benefit from highly accurate curated examples.availability and implementation: the raw data used for the evaluation are available from url:
