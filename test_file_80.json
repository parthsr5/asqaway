Telomerecat is designed to be agnostic to the number of telomeres present, making it suited for the purpose of estimating telomere length in cancer studies. Telomerecat also accounts for interstitial telomeric reads and presents a novel approach to dealing with sequencing errors. We show that Telomerecat performs well at telomere length estimation when compared to leading experimental and computational methods.

Thus, the identification of genes controlling the differentiation of these stem-like cells is becoming a successful therapeutic strategy, owing to the promise of novel targets for treating malignancies.METHODS: Recently, we developed SWIM, a software able to unveil a small pool of genes - called switch genes - critically associated with drastic changes in cell phenotype. Here, we applied SWIM to the expression profiling of glioblastoma stem-like cells and conventional glioma cell lines, in order to identify switch genes related to stem-like phenotype.RESULTS: SWIM identifies 171 switch genes that are all down-regulated in glioblastoma stem-like cells.

Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in tandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5-37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke Fahn Marsden's Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-multiple\\ sclerosi and BFMDRS-D) was evident at 6 months, 1 year and last follow-up (motor, P = 0.001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.012; disability, P = 0.009, P = 0.002 and P = 0.012).

Here, we present a network-based approach, metPropagate, that uses untargeted metabolomics (uses\\ untargeted\\ metabolomics) data from a single patient and a group of controls to prioritize candidate genes in patients with suspected IEMs. We validate metPropagate on 107 patients with IEMs diagnosed in Miller et al.

The metPropagate method ranks candidate genes by label propagation, a graph-smoothing algorithm that considers each gene's metabolic perturbation in addition to the network of interactions between neighbors. metPropagate was able to prioritize at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile of candidate genes for 92% of patients with known IEMs. Applied to patients with suspected neurometabolic disease, metPropagate placed at least one causative gene in the top 20th percentile in 9/11 patients, and ranked the causative gene more highly than Exomiser's phenotype-based ranking in 6/11 patients. Interestingly, ranking by a weighted combination of metPropagate and Exomiser scores resulted in improved prioritization.

To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276\u2009G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802\u2009T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073\u2009G>Ankylosing\\ spondyliti, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156\u2009G>Ankylosing\\ spondyliti, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3\u2009T>Ankylosing\\ spondyliti; and c.12575\u2009G>Ankylosing\\ spondyliti, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing.

Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of deep\\ cancer\\ subtype\\ classification to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by deep\\ cancer\\ subtype\\ classification captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, deep\\ cancer\\ subtype\\ classification provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping."}, {"id": "53357ca0d6d3ac6a3400004b_0003", "question": "Which enzyme is inhibited by a drug fostamatinib?", "answers": {"text": ["spleen tyrosine kinase"], "answer_start": [71]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc is developing fostamatinib, a prodrug of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R-406, for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (rheumatoid\\ arthritis), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (immune\\ thrombocytopenia) and B-cell lymphomas."}, {"id": "58d906b28acda3452900000d_0005", "question": "Where is the tafazzin (G4.5) is located in humans?", "answers": {"text": ["Xq28"], "answer_start": [43]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "The tafazzin gene (tafazzin) is located at Xq28 and encodes a protein involved in the transacylation of cardiolipin, an essential mitochondrial phospholipid"}, {"id": "51635202298dcd4e5100004f_0004", "question": "How is myotonic dystrophy inherited?", "answers": {"text": ["autosomal dominant"], "answer_start": [92]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a neuromuscular, degenerative and progressive disease, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance."}, {"id": "5e36e254b5b409ea53000010_0001", "question": "List SLC25A46-related pathologies", "answers": {"text": ["inherited optic atrophy"], "answer_start": [147]}, "type": "list", "context": "The mitochondrial protein SLC25A46 has been recently identified as a novel pathogenic cause in a wide spectrum of neurological diseases, including inherited optic atrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, Leigh syndrome, progressive myoclonic ataxia and lethal congenital pontocerebellar hypoplasia."}, {"id": "5891c90949702f2e01000001_0002", "question": "Which tool employs self organizing maps for analyzing synonymous codon usage?", "answers": {"text": ["INteractive\\ Codon\\ usage\\ Analysis"], "answer_start": [34]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "INteractive Codon usage Analysis (INteractive\\ Codon\\ usage\\ Analysis) provides an array of features useful in analysis of synonymous codon usage in whole genomes.

The statistics is used to assess the significance of an over-representation of microRNA-target interactions and then MIENTURNET filters based on the statistical significance associated with each microRNA-target interaction. In addition, the holistic approach of the network theory is used to infer possible evidences of microRNA regulation by capturing emergent properties of the microRNA-target regulatory network that would be not evident through a pairwise analysis of the individual components.CONCLUSION: MIENTURNET offers the possibility to consistently perform both statistical and network-based analyses by using only a single tool leading to a more effective prioritization of the microRNA-target interactions. This has the potential to avoid researchers without computational and informatics skills to navigate multiple websites and thus to independently investigate microRNA activity in every cellular process of interest in an easy and at the same time exhaustive way thanks to the intuitive web interface.

Thus, the identification of genes controlling the differentiation of these stem-like cells is becoming a successful therapeutic strategy, owing to the promise of novel targets for treating malignancies.METHODS: Recently, we developed SWIM, a software able to unveil a small pool of genes - called switch genes - critically associated with drastic changes in cell phenotype. Here, we applied SWIM to the expression profiling of glioblastoma stem-like cells and conventional glioma cell lines, in order to identify switch genes related to stem-like phenotype.RESULTS: SWIM identifies 171 switch genes that are all down-regulated in glioblastoma stem-like cells. This list encompasses genes like CAV1, COL5A1, COL6A3, FLNB, HMMR, ITGA3, ITGA5, mesenchymal\\-epithelial\\ transition, SDC1, THBS1, and VEGFC, involved in \"extracellular\\ matrix-receptor interaction\" and \"focal adhesion\" pathways."}, {"id": "551fd9c06b348bb82c000012_0017", "question": "ROSIER scale is used for which disorder?", "answers": {"text": ["stroke"], "answer_start": [71]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the endoplasmic\\ reticulum."}, {"id": "58a8071760087bc10a000037_0004", "question": "List peptide fragmentations methods in mass spectrometry", "answers": {"text": ["HCD"], "answer_start": [15]}, "type": "list", "context": "By integrating HCD-multiple\\ sclerosis/multiple\\ sclerosis, collision\\-induced\\ dissociation-multiple\\ sclerosis/multiple\\ sclerosis"}, {"id": "531464a6e3eabad021000014_0008", "question": "Mutation of which gene is associated with McLeod syndrome?", "answers": {"text": ["XK"], "answer_start": [75]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "The detailed characterization at the molecular biology level of this novel XK splice site mutation associated with the clinical description of the patient contributes to a better understanding of the phenotype-genotype correlation in the McLeod syndrome."}, {"id": "58bc8e7a02b8c60953000007_0006", "question": "What is plantar fasciitis", "answers": {"text": ["heel pain"], "answer_start": [55]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Although plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain,"}, {"id": "54db7c4ac0bb8dce23000001_0001", "question": "Which protein kinases have been found to phosphorylate Phospholamban and affect its biological activity?", "answers": {"text": ["protein kinase Ankylosing\\ spondyliti"], "answer_start": [88]}, "type": "list", "context": "Dephosphorylated phospholamban is an inhibitor of SR\\ Ca\\-ATPase and phosphorylation by protein kinase Ankylosing\\ spondyliti (protein\\ kinase\\ Ankylosing\\ spondyliti) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects.

Multipoint parametric linkage analysis was performed. Whole-exome sequencing was done on the proband. Linkage analysis identified a locus on chromosome 7 where exome sequencing successfully identified a homozygous two base pair duplication (c.1947_48dupCT), leading to a truncated protein p.(Y650Sfs*22) in the STAG3 gene, confirming it as the cause of Primary\\ ovarian\\ insufficiency in this family. Exome sequencing combined with linkage analyses offers a powerful tool to efficiently find novel genetic causes of rare, heterogeneous disorders, even in small single families.

This causes loss of valuable biological information in tumour samples, which are frequently heterogeneous. We have previously developed an algorithm, KC-SMART, that bases its estimate of the magnitude of the Copy\\ Number\\ Alterations at a given genomic location on kernel convolution (Klijn et al., 2008). This accounts for the intensity of the probe signal, its local genomic environment and the signal distribution across multiple samples.RESULTS: Here we extend the approach to allow comparative analyses of two groups of samples and introduce the R implementation of these two approaches. The comparative module allows for a supervised analysis to be performed, to enable the identification of regions that are differentially aberrated between two user-defined classes.We analyzed data from a series of B- and T-cell lymphomas and were able to retrieve all positive control regions (VDJ regions) in addition to a number of new regions. Ankylosing\\ spondyliti t-test employing segmented data, that we implemented, was also able to locate all the positive control regions and a number of new regions but these regions were highly fragmented.CONCLUSIONS: KC-SMARTR offers recurrent Copy\\ Number\\ Alterations and class specific Copy\\ Number\\ Alterations detection, at different genomic scales, in a single package without the need for additional segmentation. It is memory efficient and runs on a wide range of machines. Most importantly, it does not rely on data discretization and therefore maximally exploits the biological information in the array\\ Comparative\\ Genomic\\ Hybridization data.The program is freely available from the Bioconductor website http://www.bioconductor.org/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License."}, {"id": "570a6d03cf1c325851000025_0011", "question": "List sclerostin interaction partners.", "answers": {"text": ["asporin"], "answer_start": [626]}, "type": "list", "context": " Several previously unidentified full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase, gremlin-1, fetuin Ankylosing\\ spondyliti, midkine, annexin A1 and A2, and collagen \u03b11, which have established roles in bone formation or resorption processes, were bound to the sclerostin-Membrane\\ Binding\\ Protein amylose resin but not to the Membrane\\ Binding\\ Protein amylose resin.

These data files are regenerated at regular intervals by an automatic procedure that takes as input a reference genome, a comprehensive Single\\ nucleotide\\ polymorphism catalogue and a collection of PWMs. SNP2TFBS is also accessible over a web interface, enabling users to view the information provided for an individual Single\\ nucleotide\\ polymorphism, to extract Single\\ nucleotide\\ polymorphisms based on various search criteria, to annotate uploaded sets of Single\\ nucleotide\\ polymorphisms or to display statistics about the frequencies of binding sites affected by selected Single\\ nucleotide\\ polymorphisms.

Lossy compression allows for compression of data beyond its lossless limit.RESULTS: The proposed algorithm QVZ exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the previously proposed algorithms, for several distortion metrics and for the lossless case. Moreover, it allows the user to define any quasi-convex distortion function to be minimized, a feature not supported by the previous algorithms. Finally, we show that QVZ-compressed data exhibit better performance in the genotyping than data compressed with previously proposed algorithms, in the sense that for a similar rate, a genotyping closer to that achieved with the original quality values is obtained."}, {"id": "55192f20622b194345000014_0001", "question": "Which proteins are the different members of the necrotizing\\ fasciitis-kappaB family of transcription factors?", "answers": {"text": ["c-Rel"], "answer_start": [210]}, "type": "list", "context": "The transcription factor necrotizing\\ fasciitis-kappaB is composed of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of Rel/necrotizing\\ fasciitis-kappaB-family polypeptides, which include Rel-Ankylosing\\ spondyliti, c-Rel, Rel-B, necrotizing\\ fasciitis-kappaB/p50 and necrotizing\\ fasciitis-kappaB2/p52 ."}, {"id": "54ff30dc6ad7dcbc1200000f_0014", "question": "List human diseases involving genomic imprinting.", "answers": {"text": ["Angelman syndrome"], "answer_start": [144]}, "type": "list", "context": "It is particularly interesting from the clinical point of view that a number of human diseases, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, appear to involve unbalanced parental contributions of imprinted loci.

Thus, the identification of genes controlling the differentiation of these stem-like cells is becoming a successful therapeutic strategy, owing to the promise of novel targets for treating malignancies.METHODS: Recently, we developed SWIM, a software able to unveil a small pool of genes - called switch genes - critically associated with drastic changes in cell phenotype. Here, we applied SWIM to the expression profiling of glioblastoma stem-like cells and conventional glioma cell lines, in order to identify switch genes related to stem-like phenotype.RESULTS: SWIM identifies 171 switch genes that are all down-regulated in glioblastoma stem-like cells.
