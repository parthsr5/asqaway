Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail. This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation. Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation. Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA. It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a \u03b2-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion. LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots. We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter. Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers. We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva.gersteinlab.org)."}, {"id": "589635dd78275d0c4a000009_0003", "question": "Which tool is used for the identification of recurrent variants in noncoding regions?", "answers": {"text": ["LARVA"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations"}, {"id": "589635dd78275d0c4a000009_0004", "question": "Which tool is used for the identification of recurrent variants in noncoding regions?", "answers": {"text": ["LARVA"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations."}, {"id": "5a7d51dafaa1ab7d2e000017_0001", "question": "What is the administration route of IVIG in Alzheimer's disease patients?", "answers": {"text": ["Intravenous"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has shown limited promise so far in human clinical studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet overwhelmingly positive preclinical work in animals and human brain cultures support the notion that the therapy remains potentially efficacious."}, {"id": "593ff22b70f9fc6f0f000023_0001", "question": "How many Groucho-related genes (GRG) are contained in the mouse genome?", "answers": {"text": ["four"], "answer_start": [63]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family members."}, {"id": "5a87ea1861bb38fb2400000d_0001", "question": "What is a coligo?", "answers": {"text": ["circularized oligodeoxynucleotides"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "circularized oligodeoxynucleotides (coligos)"}, {"id": "5a8941c5bc7bade53a000002_0001", "question": "Which aminoacid position in the human CREB protein is phosphorylated?", "answers": {"text": ["Ser133"], "answer_start": [7]}, "type": "factoid", "context": " pCREB(Ser133) as a model system"}, {"id": "5a89800efcd1d6a10c00000c_0001", "question": "Where is the enzyme PM20D1 localized?", "answers": {"text": ["UCP1+ adipocytes"], "answer_start": [40]}, "type": "factoid", "context": " A secreted enzyme, PM20D1, enriched in UCP1+ adipocytes, exhibits catalytic and hydrolytic activity to reversibly form N-acyl amino acids."}, {"id": "5a7617b183b0d9ea66000022_0001", "question": "What is inhibited by a drug rilotumumab?", "answers": {"text": ["hepatocyte growth factor"], "answer_start": [4]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) was targeted in untreated patients in a phase III trial with MoAb rilotumumab, with or without CT, but the study was stopped because of mortality excess in the rilotumumab arm.

Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1.

We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of theC9orf72repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9% (2786/2789, 95% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions. Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions."}, {"id": "5a804f71faa1ab7d2e00001d_0002", "question": "Which algorithm is used for detection of long repeat expansions?", "answers": {"text": ["ExpansionHunter"], "answer_start": [6]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "Thus, ExpansionHunter can be used to accurately detect known pathogenic repeat expansions and provides researchers with a tool that can be used to identify new pathogenic repeat expansions."}, {"id": "5a804f71faa1ab7d2e00001d_0003", "question": "Which algorithm is used for detection of long repeat expansions?", "answers": {"text": ["ExpansionHunter"], "answer_start": [36]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length."}, {"id": "5a9d31711d1251d03b00001c_0001", "question": "What is the approximate size of gas vesicles?", "answers": {"text": ["100 nm"], "answer_start": [128]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "This number remained relatively constant while the size of the vesicles increased until they attained their maximum diamtere of 100 nm."}, {"id": "5aa50086d6d6b54f7900000c_0001", "question": "Which is the function of ubiquilins?", "answers": {"text": ["Ubiquilins, a family of ubiquitin-binding proteins, are involved in all protein degradation pathways."], "answer_start": [1]}, "type": "factoid", "context": " Ubiquilins, a family of ubiquitin-binding proteins, are involved in all protein degradation pathways."}, {"id": "5a7347a02dc08e987e00001b_0001", "question": "Gallbladder carriage is a well recognised means of spread of which bacteria?", "answers": {"text": ["Salmonella Typhi"], "answer_start": [67]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "The host-pathogen interactions occurring in the gallbladder during Salmonella Typhi colonization contribute to typhoid fever pathogenesis during the acute and chronic stages of disease.

Defining protein-protein interactions in protein complexes, and establishing the when, what and where of potential interactions, is therefore crucial to understanding the cellular function of any protein-especially those that have not been well studied by traditional molecular genetic approaches. We generated a large-scale resource of affinity-tagged expression-ready clones and used co-affinity purification combined with tandem mass-spectrometry to identify protein partners of nearly 5,000 Drosophila melanogaster proteins. The resulting protein complex \"map\" provided a blueprint of metazoan protein complex organization.

Under these circumstances, the classical Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is suboptimal. Robust procedures that maximize the power and preserve the nominal type I error rate are preferable. Moreover, performing a meta-analysis using robust procedures is of great interest and has never been addressed in the past. The primary goal of this work is to implement several robust methods for analysis and meta-analysis in the statistical package Stata and subsequently to make the software available to the scientific community.Results: The CATT under a recessive, additive and dominant model of inheritance as well as robust methods based on the Maximum Efficiency Robust Test statistic, the MAX statistic and the MIN2 were implemented in Stata. Concerning MAX and MIN2, we calculated their asymptotic null distributions relying on numerical integration resulting in a great gain in computational time without losing accuracy.

Affected individuals are fertile and achondroplasia is transmitted as a fully penetrant autosomal dominant trait, accounting for rare familial forms of the disease (10%). In contrast, homozygous achondroplasia is usually lethal in the neonatal period and affects 25% of the offspring of matings between heterozygous achondroplasia parents. The gene responsible for achondroplasia has been mapped to chromosome 4p16.3 (refs 7, 8); the genetic interval encompassing the disease gene contains a member of the fibroblast-growth-factor receptor (FGFR3) family which is expressed in articular chondrocytes. Here we report the finding of recurrent missense mutations in a CpG doublet of the transmembrane domain of the FGFR3 protein (glycine substituted with arginine at residue 380, G380R) in 17 sporadic cases and 6 unrelated familial forms of achondroplasia.

Missing X-ray residues from the PDB have been widely used as a proxy for ID when developing computational methods. This may lead to a systematic bias, where predictors deviate from biologically relevant ID. Large benchmarking sets on experimentally validated ID are scarce. Recently, the DisProt database has been renewed and expanded to include manually curated ID annotations for several hundred new proteins. This provides a large benchmark set which has not yet been used for training ID predictors.Results: Here, we describe the first systematic benchmarking of ID predictors on the new DisProt dataset. In contrast to previous assessments based on missing X-ray data, this dataset contains mostly long ID regions and a significant amount of fully ID proteins. The benchmarking shows that ID predictors work quite well on the new dataset, especially for long ID segments. However, a large fraction of ID still goes virtually undetected and the ranking of methods is different than for PDB data. In particular, many predictors appear to confound ID and regions outside X-ray structures. This suggests that the ID prediction methods capture different flavors of disorder and can benefit from highly accurate curated examples.Availability and implementation: The raw data used for the evaluation are available from URL: http://www.disprot.org/assessment/."}, {"id": "5e5015436d0a277941000037_0003", "question": "Which are the databases for intrinsic protein disorders?", "answers": {"text": ["MobiDB"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "list", "context": "MobiDB: a comprehensive database of intrinsic protein disorder annotations."}, {"id": "5e5015436d0a277941000037_0004", "question": "Which are the databases for intrinsic protein disorders?", "answers": {"text": ["DisProt"], "answer_start": [206]}, "type": "list", "context": "Disordered protein regions are key to the function of numerous processes within an organism and to the determination of a protein's biological role.

In proband 1 (V1/V2), V1 was predicted to introduce a premature termination codon (PTC), whereas V2 disrupted the exon 41 splice donor site causing incomplete skipping of exon 41. V1 and V2 impaired dynein-2 motility in vitro and perturbed IFT88 distribution within cilia. V3, homozygous in probands 2-4, is predicted to cause a PTC in a retina-predominant transcript. Analysis of retinal organoids showed that this new transcript expression increased with organoid differentiation. V4, a novel missense variant, was in trans with V5, previously associated with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD).CONCLUSION: The DYNC2H1 variants discussed herein were either hypomorphic or affecting a retina-predominant transcript and caused nonsyndromic IRD.

Extensive functional analyses of the missense variant in cell culture and zebrafish strongly suggests its pathogenic nature. Loss of IFT81 impairs ciliogenesis and, interestingly, the missense variant displayed significantly reduced rescue of ciliogenesis in the IFT81 knockdown in vitro system. Consistently, dramatic reduction of rescue efficiency of the ift81 mutant zebrafish embryo by mRNA with the missense variant was observed, further supporting its pathogenicity.Conclusions: Consistent with the function of the IFT-B complex in the maintenance of photoreceptor cilium, we report a case of mutations in a core IFT-B protein, IFT81. This represents the first report of mutations in IFT81 as a candidate gene for nonsyndromic retinal dystrophy, hence expanding the phenotype spectrum of IFT-B components."}, {"id": "601c18eb1cb411341a000010_0005", "question": "Variants in which genes cause nonsyndromic retinal degeneration?", "answers": {"text": ["USH2A"], "answer_start": [11]}, "type": "list", "context": "Defects in USH2A cause both isolated retinal disease and Usher syndrome (ie, retinal disease and deafness). To gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic USH2A retinopathy, we screened USH2A in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). Detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing USH2A variants. Further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. Overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in USH2A. Some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276\u2009G>T, p.(Cys759Phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802\u2009T>G, p.(Cys934Trp); c.10073\u2009G>A, p.(Cys3358Tyr); c.11156\u2009G>A, p.(Arg3719His); c.12295-3\u2009T>A; and c.12575\u2009G>A, p.(Arg4192His). An allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. In nonsyndromic USH2A disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. USH2A retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in Usher syndrome. The following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' USH2A allele in a patient with USH2A-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. Careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting."}, {"id": "601c18eb1cb411341a000010_0006", "question": "Variants in which genes cause nonsyndromic retinal degeneration?", "answers": {"text": ["ABHD12"], "answer_start": [22]}, "type": "list", "context": "Null mutations in the ABHD12 gene lead to PHARC syndrome, a neurodegenerative disease including polyneuropathy, hearing loss, cerebellar ataxia, RP, and early-onset cataract.

Here, we disseminate the largest-to-date lncRNA knockdown data set with molecular phenotyping (over 1000 CAGE deep-sequencing libraries) for further exploration and highlight functional roles for ZNF213-AS1 and lnc-KHDC3L-2."}, {"id": "601dbe2b1cb411341a00004d_0001", "question": "What is the indication for zolmitriptan?", "answers": {"text": ["migraine"], "answer_start": [50]}, "type": "factoid", "context": "here are many new treatment options available for migraine and more are coming.

With lipidomics datasets becoming increasingly available, lipidomic-focused software tools are required to facilitate data analysis as well as mining of public datasets, integrating lipidomics-unique molecular information such as lipid class, chain length, and unsaturation. To address this need, we developed lipidr, an open-source R/Bioconductor package for data mining and analysis of lipidomics datasets. lipidr implements a comprehensive lipidomic-focused analysis workflow for targeted and untargeted lipidomics. lipidr imports numerical matrices, Skyline exports, and Metabolomics Workbench files directly into R, automatically inferring lipid class and chain information from lipid names. Through integration with the Metabolomics Workbench API, users can search, download, and reanalyze public lipidomics datasets seamlessly. lipidr allows thorough data inspection, normalization, and uni- and multivariate analyses, displaying results as interactive visualizations. To enable interpretation of lipid class, chain length, and total unsaturation data, we also developed and implemented a novel lipid set enrichment analysis. A companion online guide with two live example datasets is presented at https://www.lipidr.org/. We expect that the ease of use and innovative features of lipidr will allow the lipidomics research community to gain novel detailed insights from lipidomics data."}, {"id": "6060838e94d57fd879000042_0006", "question": "List R packages for lipidomics", "answers": {"text": ["LipidMS"], "answer_start": [0]}, "type": "list", "context": "LipidMS: An R Package for Lipid Annotation in Untargeted Liquid Chromatography-Data Independent Acquisition-Mass Spectrometry Lipidomics."}, {"id": "6060838e94d57fd879000042_0007", "question": "List R packages for lipidomics", "answers": {"text": ["LipidMS"], "answer_start": [390]}, "type": "list", "context": "High resolution LC-MS untargeted lipidomics using data independent acquisition (DIA) has the potential to increase lipidome coverage, as it enables the continuous and unbiased acquisition of all eluting ions.
